RawFitness is a gym management system that streamlines the registration and membership processes for gym users. It allows users to create accounts by registering with a username, password, and mobile number. 
Once registered, members can log in to access their accounts, where they can view and purchase various membership plans. 
Each membership is tied to a specific duration and includes features like QR code generation for gym entry. The QR codes are unique to each membership and can be scanned for check-in purposes, 
ensuring secure and efficient access to the gym facilities.
